Make 1 set with forward sequence of 24 known indexes 
write a function to do reverse complement

Open all 4 fastq files & read in parallel
for nth record (meaning every record in file): 
        check if index 1 is in set
            if NOT in set
                write R1/R4 record to unknown files R1_unknown R2_unknown
            if index 1 IS IN set
                check if revcomp(index 2) is also in set
                    if NOT send to unknown files corresponding to read
                    if index 2 is in set
                        check line 4 of R2/R3 records for quality score of index for Q>/=30
                            if below cutoff write to unknown files corresponding to read
                            if Q>30 then:
                                check if index 1 matches revcomp(index 2)
                                    if it's a match
                                        send R1/R4 record to matched files R1_matched R2_matched
                                    if NOT matched
                                        write R1/R4 record to unmatched files R1_unmatched R2_unmatched
                                    each time you a write out a record append index1_revcomp(index2) to each header
